Mothereffin' SVG sparklines.

Orignally by [Stuart Langridge](http://kryogenix.org/days/2012/12/30/simple-svg-sparklines), based on an idea from [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com/journal/5941/).

### circle.svg

The `circle.svg` redraws itself when the page is resized, so it's always looking smart.

```html
<embed src="//sparksvg.me/circle.svg?0,4,7,10,8,12,9,7,3,0"></embed>
```
